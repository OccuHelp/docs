Maintaining accurate OSHA 300 logs is not just a regulatory requirement—it's a valuable tool for identifying workplace safety trends and preventing future injuries.

## Understanding OSHA Recordkeeping Requirements

The OSHA 300 log is a record of work-related injuries and illnesses. Employers with more than 10 employees in most industries must maintain these records.

### The Three Key Forms

1. **OSHA 300**: Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses
2. **OSHA 300A**: Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses
3. **OSHA 301**: Injury and Illness Incident Report

## What Must Be Recorded?

Record any work-related injury or illness that results in:
- Death
- Days away from work
- Restricted work or job transfer
- Medical treatment beyond first aid
- Loss of consciousness
- Significant injury or illness diagnosed by a healthcare professional

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Late Recording

Entries must be made within 7 calendar days of receiving information about a recordable case. Set up systems to ensure timely reporting.

### Misclassification

Understanding the difference between first aid and medical treatment is crucial. When in doubt, consult OSHA guidelines or a safety professional.

### Privacy Case Confusion

Certain injuries (mental illness, HIV, hepatitis, etc.) require privacy protection. Use "privacy case" instead of employee names.

## Using Data for Prevention

Your OSHA 300 log is a goldmine of safety information:
- Identify injury trends by department or job type
- Recognize seasonal patterns
- Evaluate the effectiveness of safety interventions
- Prioritize ergonomic assessments and other prevention efforts

## Digital Solutions

Modern incident management software can automate much of the OSHA recordkeeping process, reducing errors and saving time. Look for solutions that integrate with your existing safety programs.

Remember: The annual summary (Form 300A) must be posted from February 1 to April 30 each year in a visible location where notices to employees are customarily posted.
