Early intervention programs can dramatically reduce the severity and cost of workplace injuries. By addressing discomfort before it becomes a recordable injury, organizations save money and keep employees healthy.

## What is Early Intervention?

Early intervention is a proactive approach to injury management that encourages employees to report discomfort or minor injuries before they escalate into serious problems requiring medical treatment or time away from work.

## The Business Case

### Cost Savings

- Minor discomfort treated early: $50-$200
- Full workers' compensation claim: $10,000-$50,000+
- Lost productivity from absence: Immeasurable

### Improved Outcomes

Employees who receive early treatment:
- Return to full duty faster
- Experience less pain and disability
- Have higher job satisfaction
- Are less likely to develop chronic conditions

## Key Components of an Effective Program

### 1. Employee Education

Workers need to understand:
- The importance of reporting discomfort early
- That reporting won't negatively impact them
- How to access early intervention services

### 2. Easy Access to Care

Remove barriers to treatment:
- On-site or near-site services
- Flexible scheduling
- No-cost or low-cost options
- Confidential reporting mechanisms

### 3. Qualified Providers

Work with healthcare professionals who understand:
- Occupational health
- Musculoskeletal disorders
- Workplace ergonomics
- Return-to-work processes

### 4. Data Tracking

Monitor program effectiveness:
- Number of early reports
- Conversion rate to recordable injuries
- Cost per case
- Employee satisfaction

## Integration with Other Programs

Early intervention works best when combined with:
- Ergonomic assessments
- Workplace stretching programs
- Job rotation strategies
- Modified duty options

## Creating a Culture of Safety

The success of early intervention depends on trust. Employees must believe that reporting discomfort won't result in discipline or job loss. Leadership commitment and consistent messaging are essential.

Start small, measure results, and expand your program based on what works in your unique workplace environment.
