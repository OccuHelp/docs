## The Office Ergonomics Challenge

### Common Issues

Office workers frequently experience:
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Lower back discomfort
- Wrist and hand problems (carpal tunnel syndrome)
- Eye strain and headaches
- Hip and leg issues from prolonged sitting

### Risk Factors

**Prolonged Static Postures:**
- Sitting for extended periods
- Fixed head/neck positions
- Sustained arm positions
- Limited movement

**Repetitive Motions:**
- Typing and mousing
- Phone use
- Document handling
- Repetitive clicking

**Poor Workstation Setup:**
- Incorrect monitor height
- Improper chair adjustment
- Inadequate keyboard/mouse placement
- Poor lighting
- Cluttered workspace

## Workstation Ergonomics

### Monitor Setup

**Height:**
- Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- Viewing angle 10-20 degrees below horizontal
- Prevents neck strain

**Distance:**
- 20-26 inches from eyes (arm's length)
- Adjust based on vision and screen size
- Larger screens may need greater distance

**Position:**
- Directly in front of user
- Perpendicular to windows (reduce glare)
- Tilt slightly back (10-20 degrees)

**Multiple Monitors:**
- Primary monitor directly ahead
- Secondary monitor at angle
- Both at same height
- Consider curved arrangement

### Keyboard and Mouse

**Keyboard Position:**
- Directly in front of user
- At elbow height when seated
- Slight negative tilt or flat
- Close to body (avoid reaching)

**Mouse Placement:**
- Same height as keyboard
- Close to keyboard
- Within easy reach
- Consider alternative input devices

**Technique:**
- Wrists neutral (not bent up/down or side to side)
- Elbows at 90-110 degrees
- Shoulders relaxed
- Light touch on keys
- Whole arm movement for mouse

**Accessories:**
- Keyboard tray for proper height
- Wrist rest for breaks (not while typing)
- Ergonomic keyboard (split, curved)
- Vertical or trackball mouse

### Chair Selection and Adjustment

**Essential Features:**

- Recline 100-110 degrees
- Full back contact
- Adjustable tension

**Armrests:**
- Support forearms lightly
- Shoulders relaxed

- Elbows at 90-110 degrees
- Consider adjustable height desk

**Work Surface:**
- Adequate space for tasks
- Frequently used items within reach
- Organized to minimize reaching
- Non-reflective surface

**Under-Desk Clearance:**
- Room for legs
- No obstructions
- Space to change positions
- Footrest if needed

### Lighting

**General Lighting:**
- Adequate ambient light
- No glare on screen
- Uniform distribution
- 300-500 lux for office work

**Task Lighting:**
- Adjustable desk lamp
- For document work
- Positioned to avoid glare
- LED for reduced heat and energy

**Screen Glare:**
- Position away from windows
- Use blinds or curtains
- Anti-glare screen filter
- Adjust screen brightness
- Clean screen regularly

### Phone Use

**Headset:**
- Essential for frequent phone use
- Prevents neck strain from cradling
- Wireless for mobility
- Comfortable fit

**Phone Placement:**
- Within easy reach
- On non-dominant side (if using handset)
- Speed dial for frequent numbers

## Posture and Movement

### Proper Sitting Posture

**Neutral Spine:**
- Maintain natural curves
- Lumbar support
- Shoulders back and down
- Head balanced over shoulders

**Upper Body:**
- Shoulders relaxed
- Elbows close to body
- Forearms parallel to floor
- Wrists neutral

**Lower Body:**
- Hips back in chair
- Thighs parallel to floor
- Feet flat on floor or footrest
- Weight evenly distributed

### Movement Strategies

**Micro-Breaks:**
- Every 20-30 minutes
- 30-60 seconds
- Look away from screen
- Stretch or change position
- Stand or walk briefly

**Macro-Breaks:**
- Every 60-90 minutes
- 5-10 minutes
- Leave workstation
- Walk, stretch, different task
- Rest eyes

**Postural Variation:**
- Shift positions frequently
- Alternate sitting and standing
- Change tasks
- Vary activities
- Avoid prolonged static postures

### Stretching Exercises

**Neck:**
- Chin tucks
