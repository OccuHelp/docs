Pre-employment and post-offer testing can significantly reduce workplace injuries, but only when implemented correctly. Understanding the legal requirements and best practices is essential for an effective program.

## The Purpose of Employment Testing

Employment testing helps ensure that candidates can safely perform the essential functions of a job. Benefits include:
- Reduced early-tenure injuries
- Lower workers' compensation costs
- Improved employee retention
- Better job-person fit
- Enhanced workplace safety

## Legal Framework

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

**Key Requirements:**
- Testing must be job-related and consistent with business necessity
- All candidates for the same position must be tested
- Testing can only occur after a conditional job offer
- Medical examinations must be conducted by licensed healthcare professionals
- Results must be kept confidential

### Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

Testing must not discriminate based on:
- Age
- Race
- Gender
- Disability
- National origin
- Religion

## Types of Employment Testing

### 1. Physical Ability Testing (PAT)

Tests specific physical capabilities required for the job:
- Lifting capacity
- Carrying ability
- Pushing/pulling strength
- Grip strength
- Cardiovascular endurance

**Example**: Warehouse position requiring 50-lb lifts
- Test: Lift 50 lbs from floor to waist height
- Frequency: Match job demands (e.g., 10 lifts in 5 minutes)

### 2. Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE)

Comprehensive assessment of:
- Multiple physical demands
- Sustained activity tolerance
- Positional tolerances
- Overall work capacity

**Best for**: Jobs with complex, varied physical demands

### 3. Job Simulation Testing

Candidates perform actual or simulated job tasks:
- Most job-specific
- High face validity
- Realistic preview of work

**Example**: Firefighter candidate carries equipment up stairs while wearing gear

### 4. Medical Examinations

Conducted by physician or licensed provider:
- Health history
- Physical examination
- Vision/hearing screening
- Drug screening (if applicable)
- Fitness for duty determination

## Developing a Testing Program

### Step 1: Conduct Physical Demands Analysis

Document the essential physical requirements of the job:
- Frequency and duration of activities
- Force requirements
- Postural demands
- Environmental conditions

### Step 2: Design Job-Related Tests

Tests must:
- Measure essential job functions
- Reflect actual job demands
- Be validated for the specific position
- Have established pass/fail criteria

### Step 3: Establish Validation

**Content Validation**: Test clearly measures job requirements
**Criterion Validation**: Test scores correlate with job performance
**Construct Validation**: Test measures underlying physical constructs needed for job

### Step 4: Set Cut Scores

Determine passing criteria based on:
- Minimum job requirements
- Safety considerations
- Statistical analysis
- Expert judgment

### Step 5: Standardize Administration

Ensure consistency through:
- Written protocols
- Trained test administrators
- Calibrated equipment
- Controlled environment
- Standardized instructions

### Step 6: Document Everything

Maintain records of:
- Job analysis
- Test development process
- Validation studies
- Individual test results
- Accommodations provided
- Adverse impact analyses

## Accommodations and the Interactive Process

When a candidate cannot pass a test due to a disability:

1. **Engage in interactive process**
2. **Determine if accommodation is reasonable**
3. **Consider alternative tests or modifications**
4. **Evaluate if candidate can perform essential functions with accommodation**
5. **Document the process and decision**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Testing Before Job Offer
**Problem**: ADA violation
**Solution**: Only test after conditional offer is made

### Using Generic Tests
**Problem**: Not job-specific, difficult to defend
**Solution**: Develop tests based on actual job demands

### Inconsistent Administration
**Problem**: Discrimination claims, unreliable results
**Solution**: Standardize all procedures

### Inadequate Documentation
**Problem**: Cannot defend program if challenged
**Solution**: Document job analysis, validation, and all decisions

### Setting Arbitrary Standards
**Problem**: May screen out qualified candidates
**Solution**: Base standards on actual job requirements

## Measuring Program Effectiveness

Track these metrics:
- Early-tenure injury rates
- Test pass rates
- Adverse impact ratios
- Employee retention (first year)
- Workers' compensation costs
- Time to productivity

## Alternatives and Complements to Testing

### Conditional Offers with Restrictions
Hire with understanding that certain tasks may be modified or restricted.

### Graduated Onboarding
Start new employees with lighter duties, progressing to full demands.

### Enhanced Training
Provide additional training and conditioning for new employees.

### Ergonomic Improvements
Modify jobs to reduce physical demands rather than screening candidates.

## Working with Testing Vendors

If outsourcing testing, ensure vendors:
- Understand ADA and EEOC requirements
- Have experience in your industry
- Provide validation documentation
- Train your staff
- Offer ongoing support
- Maintain proper credentials

## Ongoing Program Management

### Annual Review
- Analyze test results and outcomes
- Review adverse impact data
- Update tests if jobs change
- Ensure continued compliance
- Assess program effectiveness

### Continuous Improvement
- Gather feedback from candidates and hiring managers
- Refine tests based on data
- Stay current on legal developments
- Benchmark against industry standards

A well-designed employment testing program protects both your organization and your employees. The key is ensuring that tests are truly job-related, consistently administered, and properly documented.
