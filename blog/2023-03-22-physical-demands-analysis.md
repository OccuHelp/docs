Physical Demands Analysis (PDA) is a cornerstone of effective workplace injury prevention programs. By understanding the physical requirements of each job, organizations can make better hiring decisions and create safer work environments.

## What is a Physical Demands Analysis?

A PDA is a detailed description of the physical requirements necessary to perform a specific job. It documents:
- Strength requirements (lifting, pushing, pulling)
- Postural demands (standing, sitting, bending)
- Environmental conditions
- Frequency and duration of physical activities
- Cognitive and sensory requirements

## Why PDAs Matter

### Pre-Employment Testing

PDAs form the foundation for legally defensible employment testing. By matching candidates' physical capabilities to job requirements, you can:
- Reduce early-tenure injuries
- Improve employee retention
- Ensure ADA compliance
- Minimize workers' compensation costs

### Return-to-Work Programs

When an employee is recovering from an injury, PDAs help medical providers understand exactly what the job entails, enabling more accurate return-to-work recommendations.

## Conducting an Effective PDA

1. **Observe the Job**: Watch employees perform tasks throughout an entire shift
2. **Measure Physical Demands**: Use force gauges, metabolic testing, and other tools
3. **Interview Workers**: Get firsthand accounts of job challenges
4. **Document Everything**: Create detailed, objective records
5. **Review and Update**: Jobs change—PDAs should too

## Integration with Other Programs

PDAs work best when integrated with:
- Ergonomic assessments
- Job task analysis
- Injury tracking systems
- Wellness programs

A comprehensive PDA program is an investment in your workforce's health and your organization's bottom line.
