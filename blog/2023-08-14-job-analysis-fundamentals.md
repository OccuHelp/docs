## What is Job Analysis?

Job analysis is the systematic process of collecting information about a job, including:
- Tasks and responsibilities
- Knowledge, skills, and abilities required
- Physical and mental demands
- Working conditions
- Equipment and tools used
- Performance standards

## Why Job Analysis Matters for Safety

### Foundation for Multiple Programs

Job analysis supports:
- **Physical Demands Analysis**: Documenting physical requirements
- **Employment Testing**: Developing job-related tests
- **Ergonomic Assessments**: Understanding risk factors
- **Training Programs**: Identifying competency needs
- **Job Descriptions**: Creating accurate documentation
- **Return-to-Work**: Establishing modified duty options

### Legal Protection

Well-documented job analyses provide:
- ADA compliance support
- Defense for employment decisions
- Workers' compensation documentation
- OSHA compliance evidence
- Reasonable accommodation basis

### Injury Prevention

Understanding jobs helps:
- Identify hazards
- Design controls
- Match workers to jobs
- Prevent overexertion
- Reduce ergonomic risks

## Types of Job Analysis

### 1. Task-Oriented Analysis

**Focus**: What workers do

**Components**:
- List of tasks
- Frequency of tasks
- Importance of tasks
- Time spent on tasks
- Difficulty level

**Best for**: Training development, procedure writing

### 2. Worker-Oriented Analysis

**Focus**: What characteristics workers need

**Components**:
- Knowledge requirements
- Skills needed
- Abilities required
- Personal characteristics
- Experience level

**Best for**: Hiring, selection, training needs assessment

### 3. Hybrid Analysis

**Focus**: Both tasks and worker requirements

**Components**:
- Comprehensive task list
- Required competencies
- Physical demands
- Environmental conditions
- Performance standards

**Best for**: Comprehensive safety programs

## Job Analysis Methods

### 1. Observation

**Process**:
- Watch workers perform job
- Note activities and methods
- Observe throughout full work cycle
- Multiple workers and shifts

**Advantages**:
- See actual work performed
- Identify variations
- Understand context
- Capture non-verbal aspects

**Limitations**:
- Time-consuming
- May miss infrequent tasks
- Observer effect (workers may change behavior)
- Difficult for cognitive tasks

### 2. Interviews

**Process**:
- Talk with workers and supervisors
- Ask about tasks, requirements, challenges
- Probe for details
- Verify information

**Advantages**:
- Capture worker knowledge
- Understand reasoning
- Identify infrequent tasks
- Build relationships

**Limitations**:
- Subjective
- May miss unconscious competencies
- Time-intensive
- Requires skilled interviewer

### 3. Questionnaires/Surveys

**Process**:
- Distribute structured questions
- Workers rate tasks, frequency, importance
- Collect from multiple incumbents
- Analyze responses

**Advantages**:
- Efficient for multiple workers
- Quantifiable data
- Standardized information
- Less time per person

**Limitations**:
- May miss nuances
- Requires literacy
- Limited depth
- No opportunity for clarification

### 4. Work Diaries/Logs

**Process**:
- Workers record activities
- Track time spent
- Note conditions and challenges
- Review over period of time

**Advantages**:
- Captures actual work
- Identifies variations
- Worker involvement
- Real-time data

**Limitations**:
- Burdensome for workers
- May be incomplete
- Requires discipline
- Potential for bias

### 5. Subject Matter Expert (SME) Panels

**Process**:
- Assemble experienced workers and supervisors
- Facilitate group discussion
- Build consensus on job requirements
- Document findings

**Advantages**:
- Leverages expertise
- Builds consensus
- Efficient
- Comprehensive

**Limitations**:
- May reflect ideal vs. actual
- Group dynamics can influence
- Requires skilled facilitation

### 6. Critical Incident Technique

**Process**:
- Identify critical job situations
- Analyze effective and ineffective behaviors
- Determine key competencies
- Document examples

**Advantages**:
- Identifies important competencies
- Provides concrete examples
- Focuses on outcomes
- Useful for training

**Limitations**:
- May miss routine tasks
- Relies on memory
- Time-intensive
- Requires many incidents

## Conducting a Job Analysis

### Step 1: Plan the Analysis

**Define Purpose**:
- What will the analysis be used for?
- What level of detail is needed?
- What resources are available?

**Select Jobs**:
- Prioritize based on:
  - Injury history
  - Number of incumbents
  - Physical demands
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Business criticality

**Choose Methods**:
- Match methods to purpose
- Consider resources
- Plan for multiple methods
- Ensure validity

### Step 2: Collect Information

**Gather Background**:
- Current job descriptions
- Injury records
- Training materials
- Performance standards
- Equipment manuals

**Conduct Field Work**:
- Observe workers
- Interview incumbents and supervisors
- Administer surveys
- Review work samples
- Measure physical demands

**Document Thoroughly**:
- Take detailed notes
- Photograph work areas
- Video record tasks (with permission)
- Measure forces and distances
- Record environmental conditions

### Step 3: Analyze Data

**Organize Information**:
- Group similar tasks
- Identify patterns
- Note variations
- Determine frequency and importance

**Identify Requirements**:
- Physical demands
- Cognitive requirements
- Sensory needs
- Environmental exposures
- Social interactions

**Assess Hazards**:
- Injury risks
- Ergonomic factors
- Chemical exposures
- Safety hazards
- Psychosocial stressors

### Step 4: Document Findings

**Create Job Analysis Report**:
- Job summary
- Essential functions
- Task list with details
- Physical demands
- Working conditions
- Required competencies
- Hazards and controls

**Develop Supporting Documents**:
- Updated job descriptions
- Physical demands analysis
- Training requirements
- Safety procedures
- Ergonomic recommendations

### Step 5: Validate Results

**Review with Stakeholders**:

## Common Challenges

**Challenge**: Jobs vary significantly between workers
**Solution**: Analyze multiple incumbents; document acceptable variations

**Challenge**: Jobs are constantly changing
**Solution**: Focus on core functions; plan for regular updates

**Challenge**: Workers can't articulate what they do
**Solution**: Use observation; ask about specific situations

**Challenge**: Limited time and resources
**Solution**: Prioritize high-risk jobs; use efficient methods

**Challenge**: Resistance from workers or management
**Solution**: Communicate purpose and benefits; involve stakeholders

## Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Methods**: Triangulate data for accuracy
2. **Involve Incumbents**: Workers are the experts
3. **Observe Actual Work**: Don't rely solely on descriptions
4. **Consider Variations**: Account for shifts, seasons, experience levels
5. **Focus on Essential Functions**: Distinguish critical from marginal tasks
6. **Document Thoroughly**: Detailed records support multiple uses
7. **Validate Findings**: Verify accuracy with stakeholders
8. **Keep Current**: Jobs change; analyses must too
9. **Link to Outcomes**: Connect to safety, performance, business goals
10. **Professional Approach**: Use systematic, defensible methods

Job analysis is an investment that pays dividends across multiple safety and HR functions. When done well, it provides the foundation for effective, legally defensible programs that protect workers and support business objectives.
