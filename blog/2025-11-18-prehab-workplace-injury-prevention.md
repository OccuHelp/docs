Prehabilitation—or "prehab"—is the proactive approach to preparing the body for physical demands before injury occurs. In the workplace, prehab programs build resilience and reduce injury risk.

## What is Prehabilitation?

Prehabilitation is preventive conditioning that:
- Strengthens muscles used in job tasks
- Improves flexibility and range of motion
- Enhances balance and coordination
- Builds endurance for sustained activity
- Prepares the body for physical demands

Unlike rehabilitation (treating existing injuries), prehab prevents injuries from occurring in the first place.

## The Science Behind Prehab

### Biomechanical Preparation

**Muscle Conditioning:**
- Stronger muscles better support joints
- Improved endurance delays fatigue
- Enhanced power for demanding tasks
- Better muscle balance prevents compensation

**Flexibility:**
- Greater range of motion reduces strain
- Improved tissue elasticity
- Better movement patterns
- Reduced risk of muscle tears

**Neuromuscular Control:**
- Improved coordination
- Better proprioception (body awareness)
- Faster reaction times
- Enhanced movement quality

### Physiological Benefits

- Improved cardiovascular fitness
- Better metabolic health
- Enhanced tissue healing capacity
- Reduced inflammation
- Stronger immune function

## Prehab vs. Other Prevention Strategies

### Prehab vs. Stretching Programs

**Stretching**: Passive flexibility improvement
**Prehab**: Active strengthening and conditioning

Both are valuable; prehab is more comprehensive.

### Prehab vs. Wellness Programs

**Wellness**: General health improvement
**Prehab**: Job-specific physical preparation

Prehab complements wellness by targeting work demands.

### Prehab vs. Ergonomics

**Ergonomics**: Modify the work to fit the worker
**Prehab**: Prepare the worker for the work

Both are essential; neither alone is sufficient.
