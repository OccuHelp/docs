Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are critical for chemical safety and OSHA compliance, but managing them can be challenging. Modern digital solutions make SDS management more efficient and accessible than ever.

## Understanding Safety Data Sheets

### What is an SDS?

A Safety Data Sheet (formerly MSDS - Material Safety Data Sheet) is a detailed document that provides information about:
- Chemical composition
- Physical and chemical properties
- Health hazards
- Protective measures
- Safety precautions for handling and storage
- Emergency procedures

### OSHA Requirements

Under the Hazard Communication Standard (HazCom 2012), employers must:
- Maintain SDS for all hazardous chemicals
- Make SDS readily accessible to employees
- Ensure SDS are in English (translations allowed as supplements)
- Update SDS when new information becomes available
- Train employees on how to read and use SDS

## The 16-Section GHS Format

Since 2012, SDS must follow the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) format:

1. **Identification**: Product name, manufacturer, emergency contacts
2. **Hazard(s) Identification**: Classification, label elements, hazards
3. **Composition/Information on Ingredients**: Chemical components
4. **First-Aid Measures**: Emergency response procedures
5. **Fire-Fighting Measures**: Suitable extinguishing methods
6. **Accidental Release Measures**: Spill cleanup procedures
7. **Handling and Storage**: Safe practices
8. **Exposure Controls/Personal Protection**: PPE requirements
9. **Physical and Chemical Properties**: Appearance, odor, pH, etc.
10. **Stability and Reactivity**: Chemical stability, incompatibilities
11. **Toxicological Information**: Health effects
12. **Ecological Information**: Environmental impact
13. **Disposal Considerations**: Waste disposal methods
14. **Transport Information**: Shipping classifications
15. **Regulatory Information**: Applicable regulations
16. **Other Information**: Revision date, references
